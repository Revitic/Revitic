Hi there! I'm known as [Revitic](https://www.roblox.com/users/151869111/profile) on Roblox, but most people call me Rev. I've been developing on the Roblox platform for over 4 years now primarily creating **__code__** and **__user interface__**. Typically, I program in Lua and JavaScript using [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) with Roblox Studio, and Visual Studio Code. I've always been a team player, you can easily rely on me to fit well within a team. I work well with others, and I'm an extremely committed worker. I never give up on a task until it's done. I take my work very seriously, and lots of people know that about me. Most of my projects/tasks are themed around the SCP Genre, but I'm experienced in creating games with all different types of themes!
