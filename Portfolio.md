Hi there! I'm known as [Revitic](https://www.roblox.com/users/151869111/profile) on Roblox, but most people call me Rev. I've been developing on the Roblox platform for over 4 years now primarily creating **code** and **user interface**. I've always been a team player, you can easily rely on me to fit well within a team. I work well with others, and I'm an extremely committed worker. I never give up on a task until it's done. I take my work very seriously, and lots of people know that about me.
