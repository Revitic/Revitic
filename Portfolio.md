Hi there! I'm known as [Revitic](https://www.roblox.com/users/151869111/profile) on Roblox, but most people call me Rev. I've been developing on the Roblox platform for over 4 years now primarily creating **__code__** and **__user interface__**. I've always been a team player, you can easily rely on me to fit well within a team. I work well with others, and I'm an extremely committed worker. I never give up on a task until it's done. I take my work very seriously, and lots of people know that about me. Most of my projects/tasks are themed around the SCP Genre, but I'm experienced in creating games with all different types of themes!

I'm a programmer who is fluent in Lua and JavaScript. I'm an experienced user of Github, [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo), and Visual Studio Code. I've worked on many projects in the past, including some of my own. I'm also familiar with OOP on Roblox (Object Oriented Programming). I've created multiple frameworks to speed up my development process on the projects I own.

Note: Some of the showcases below are simply **practice games**, meaning some elements of the games shown lack quality due to them just being for practice and not planned to be published.
